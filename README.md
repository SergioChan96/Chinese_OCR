# Steps for Project
1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Bounding box for individual characters
3. Cut individual characters out
4. Build dictionary of characters
5. Compare both

# Ideas for transformation and comparing
- Use SIFT to compare images
- make combination of filters to detect edges and corners
- compare binary images to grayscale images for accuracy and speed

# Future tasks that could be done but arent necessary
- Train neural network to do the same task without filters
- Translate the text
